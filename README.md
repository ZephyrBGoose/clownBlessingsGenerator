Student Project for Codecademy 

Clown Blessings Generator is still a work in progress. 

In its current state it randomly generates nonsense riddles from a short collection of nursery rhymes.

In its finished state you'll be able to pick between nonsense riddles, rhymed poems or metered and rhymed poems from a much larger database. 

But for now, please enjoy trying to interpret these cryptic blessings from Mother Goose!
